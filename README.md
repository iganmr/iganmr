## HELP

Basically here for the help. I am quite familiar with html and css* However since I recently started diving into C# (via Unity, yes)  I get more interested in using code to create. 

Hoping to find a platform that can help me with this. And maybe integrate it in my classes at a later point, as I am teaching at the advertising department of the art academy here in Rotterdam.

\* (and how to 'brake'/bend/mend it, as can be seen via my 2020 work at htmlfilm.net)

## INTR

Yes do have interests. But get in contact with me, would love to have a chat!
