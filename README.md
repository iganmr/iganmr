👉 I would not consider myself a developer. And my work is not exclusively code based I have a background in Fine Arts and Interior Architecture

🤦‍♂️ Here for the help,basically. I am quite familiar with html and css, however since I recently dove into C# (via Unity, yes) I get more interested in using code to create. Github is still a bit overwhelming as I try to wrap my head around it. But it seems like a platform and network where I can start to learn a lot more. which is the one thing i love doing,.
